          Currently, I am a Web Developer freelancer, wanting to help other people who would need my
          expertise in order to make their products come to life. I love building projects and I
          enjoy the nitty gritty aspect of creating optimized and efficient code.

        <h2 className={commonStyles["sub-heading"]}>Game Developer üéÆ</h2>
        <p className={commonStyles["paragraph"]}>
          On the side, since I love playing games, I've also dabbled in some Game Development. I've
          worked on personal projects that involve making games with libraries in C++, Unity, and
          Godot. Check those out in my portfolio.

          Finishing things fast üí® & Planning things ‚úçÔ∏è
        </h2>
        <p className={commonStyles["paragraph"]}>
          I always strive to deliver projects as fast as possible. There is always a trade-off with
          the quality of the project over the speed of delivery. For me, I always strive to achieve
          both of those without compromising each other. In order to do this, I always tackle
          problems with a careful plan. Fortunately, I also love planning things out, it is one of
          the favorite process that I do when I begin with projects that I will be handling. I take
          my time to plan and organize things, and based from experience, tackling problems with a
          plan will always have merits over tackling problems without a plan.
